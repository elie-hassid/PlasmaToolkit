# PlasmaToolkit – A 0D Plasma Simulation Toolkit

PlasmaToolkit is a Python-based 0D plasma simulation framework for modeling plasma kinetics. It leverages the BOLOS solver for computing electron energy distribution functions (EEDFs) and reaction rates (note: BOLOS is an external solver and is not developed within this toolkit).

**Key features:**

- Extensive reaction libraries for neutral, ion, and electron-impact processes.
- Integration with BOLOS to calculate electron-driven reaction rates.
- Electric circuit coupling to account for power supply and plasma–circuit interactions.
- Flexible configuration for species, reactions, and initial plasma conditions.
- 0D plasma modeling to simulate time evolution of species densities, plasma energy, and electrical characteristics.

PlasmaToolkit is ideal for researchers, educators, and engineers studying plasma kinetics, plasma-powered devices, or developing custom plasma chemistry models.
